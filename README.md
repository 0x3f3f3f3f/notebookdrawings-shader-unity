# 'notebook drawings' Shader for Unity3D

This is a Unity3D port (GLSL to ShaderLab) of the excellent ['notebook drawings' post-processing shader by flockaroo](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtVGD1), published on Shadertoy 2016-Sep-21.

This repo contains a Unity3D project including the [translated shader](Assets/NotebookDrawingsShader/NotebookDrawings.shader), an [image effect script](Assets/NotebookDrawingsShader/NotebookDrawingsFX.cs) for your camera and a very basic demo scene.
